Here a control for a chicken flap with an OLED 1309 display is implemented. 
The flap is controlled via 6 buttons, also a clock is implemented,
whereby a timer can be set for the opening and/or optionally,
closing of the chicken flap. 
The height which the flap must cover is variably adjustable.
In the config.h you can find most of the settings which are easy to adjust this way.
